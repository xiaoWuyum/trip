# Easy Stay Mobile Client

This project is a Taro + React application.

## Setup

1. Run `npm install` in the project root to install dependencies.
2. Note: This directory was scaffolded manually. For a complete Taro configuration (config files, etc.), you might want to run `npx @tarojs/cli init` in a separate folder and copy the config files here, or use the standard Taro template structure.

## Structure
- `src/pages`: Application pages
- `src/components`: Reusable components
- `src/services`: API services
